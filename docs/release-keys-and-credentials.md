# Release Keys and Credentials

These are non comprehensive keys and credentials that are used in the backend service for a fully functional release deployment.

## Deploy Key

This is a secret key that the backend service uses to authenticate network requests. Find it in the `src-tauri/src/constants/network.rs` file.

```rust
pub const DEPLOY_KEY: &str = "your_deploy_key_here";
```

### Base URL

This is the base URL for the backend service we deployed to the [smbCloud cloud deployment platform](https://smbcloud.xyz). Find it in the `src-tauri/src/constants/network.rs` file.

```rust
API_BASE_URL: "https://your-backend-identifier.5mb.app"
```

### Wallet Related Keys

Price data and swap APIs are from Jupiter and Birdeye. Find them in the

`crates/constants/src/constants.rs`

```rust
pub const BIRDEYE_API_KEY: &str = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```

### Solana RPC Servers

We are using Quiknode. Contact us if you want to sponsor us.

`src-tauri/src/constants/rpc.rs`
```rust
const SOLANA_RPC_NAMESPACE: &str = "your_namespace";
const SOLANA_RPC_ID: &str = "your_id";
```

### Fiat-to-crypto Services

We are using Stripe and only available in the EU.

Stripe secret key in the `src-tauri/src/constants/onramp.rs`.

```toml
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "your_stripe_secret_key"
```

Other keys are in the `lib/crate/generated.ts`.

```typescript
/* This file is generated and managed by tsync */

export const STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "your_stripe_publishable_key";
```

Now you are ready to build [NotWallet Crypto non-custodial Solana crypto wallet](https://github.com/TheStableFoundation/notwallet) for production release.
